# Capstone_Project
### Problem Statement

The e-commerce industry has revolutionized the way people shop, with customers placing orders directly from websites rather than relying on physical stores. Companies like Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra have set high standards in this space by offering personalized shopping experiences through advanced recommendation systems.

Ebuss, a growing e-commerce company, operates across various categories, including household essentials, books, personal care, medicines, beauty products, appliances, kitchenware, and healthcare products. To compete with established leaders and capture a larger market share, Ebuss seeks to enhance its recommendation system by integrating sentiment analysis into the process.

As a senior Machine Learning Engineer, your task is to develop and deploy a **Sentiment-Based Product Recommendation System** that analyzes customer reviews and ratings to provide personalized and accurate recommendations, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and engagement.

### Project Objectives:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Use customer reviews to identify sentiments and enhance the relevance of product recommendations.
2. **Recommendation System**: Develop and evaluate both **User-User** and **Item-Item Collaborative Filtering** models to determine the best approach.
3. **Integration**: Combine sentiment analysis and collaborative filtering to provide sentiment-driven recommendations.
4. **Deployment**: Build a user-friendly application to deploy the system on a cloud platform for live use.

### Detailed Steps:

#### **1. Data Exploration and Analysis**
   - Load and explore the dataset containing user reviews, ratings, and product details.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution, identify trends, and detect missing or inconsistent data.

#### **2. Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant data points.
   - Standardize data formats (e.g., timestamps, product IDs).
   - Normalize text data to ensure consistency.

#### **3. Text Preprocessing**
   - Preprocess customer reviews to prepare them for sentiment analysis.
     - Steps include:
       - Lowercasing text.
       - Removing punctuation, stop words, and special characters.
       - Tokenization and lemmatization.

#### **4. Feature Extraction**
   - Convert preprocessed text into numerical features for model training:
     - Use techniques such as **TF-IDF**, **CountVectorizer**, or **Word Embeddings** (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).

#### **5. Sentiment Analysis Model**
   - Train a text classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Networks) to predict sentiment labels (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
   - Evaluate the sentiment model on test data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

#### **6. Recommendation System Development**
   - Build two collaborative filtering models:
     - **User-User Collaborative Filtering**: Recommend products based on similar users.
     - **Item-Item Collaborative Filtering**: Recommend products based on similar items.
   - Evaluate both models using metrics such as **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** to identify the best-performing approach.

#### **7. Sentiment-Driven Recommendations**
   - Integrate the sentiment analysis model into the recommendation system to refine predictions:
     - Filter recommended products to prioritize those with positive sentiment scores.
     - Re-rank recommendations to reflect both collaborative filtering scores and sentiment analysis results.

#### **8. Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the overall performance of the sentiment-based recommendation system:
     - Compare predicted recommendations against actual user preferences.
     - Assess improvements in recommendation relevance due to sentiment integration.

#### **9. Flask Application Development**
   - Build a web-based application using Flask:
     - Implement REST API endpoints for fetching recommendations.
     - Create a simple and user-friendly interface for users to input preferences and view recommendations.

#### **10. Deployment on digitalocean**
   - Package the Flask application and deploy it on **digitalocean**:
     - Ensure the application is accessible via a public URL.
     - Use digitalocean's environment configuration to manage dependencies and model files.

### Deliverables:
1. **Trained Models**: Sentiment analysis and recommendation system models.
2. **Pickle Files**: Serialized models and preprocessing components for deployment.
3. **Flask Application**: A Python-based web app providing recommendation services.
4. **Deployed System**: A live application hosted on digitalocean with a user interface.

---

### Outcome:
A fully functional sentiment-based product recommendation system that delivers personalized, accurate, and sentiment-driven recommendations, enhancing the shopping experience for Ebuss customers and improving the company's competitive position in the e-commerce market.
